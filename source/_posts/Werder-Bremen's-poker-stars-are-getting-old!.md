#  Werder Bremen's poker stars are getting old!

The Werder Bremen team of the 2017-2018 season is aging. The average age of the starters in their recent match against Hoffenheim was 29.8 years old, with Florian Grillitsch as the youngest at 21 and Claudio Pizarro as the eldest at 39. This is significantly higher than the Bundesliga average of 26 years old. And with their older players, come some notable injuries. Zlatko Junuzovic, who is 31, was taken out of the game due to a heel injury after only playing for 23 minutes.

It would be fair to say that Werder Bremen are not having their best season so far and their older players are starting to show their age. With an average position of fifteenth in the Bundesliga standings and still currently without a win in 2018, they have had to rely more on their experienced players than ever before. This has resulted in some inconsistent performances from the team as a whole, as well as several injuries to key players.

The question now is whether Werder Bremen will be able to hold on to these veteran players for much longer or if they will start to look towards younger replacements in the near future. Even though they may be getting older, these players are still valuable assets to the team and could potentially help them make a comeback in the second half of the season.

#  SV Werder Bremen prove they're still a force to be reckoned with at poker

A convincing 3-1 victory over FC Bayern München in the semi-finals of the DFB Pokal showed SV Werder Bremen are far from a spent force in German poker.

The Green and Whites were superb on the night, playing some scintillating football to deservedly dispatch the Bundesliga champions.

Bremen took the lead in just the fourth minute when Max Kruse slotted home after a wonderful team move. The hosts doubled their advantage 10 minutes later when Fin Bartels headed in from close range, and things went from bad to worse for Bayern when Mats Hummels was sent off for two yellow cards midway through the first half.

Robert Lewandowski got one back for Bayern early in the second period, but Werder saw out the game comfortably to book their place in the final, where they will face either Eintracht Frankfurt or Borussia Dortmund.

This latest triumph is yet another indication that Bremen are still a powerful side at poker, and they will be determined to go all the way and lift their first domestic cup since 2004.

#  Werder Bremen's old guard dominate poker scene

Werder Bremen's old guard are taking the poker world by storm.

Veterans such as Max Kruse, Zlatko Junuzovic and Fin Bartels have been putting in some impressive performances in tournaments around the globe, with Kruse and Bartels both taking home titles in the last few months.

This has led to Bremen becoming one of the most successful clubs in European poker, with their players racking up an impressive array of victories and final table appearances.

Kruse has been one of the main stars of Bremen's poker success, with two titles and 10 final table appearances in major tournaments over the last year. The 29-year-old has also collected more than $600,000 in prize money during that time, establishing himself as one of the top poker players in Europe.

Bartels has also been in superb form, with a title win and three final table appearances in major tournaments in 2017 alone. The 30-year-old has already won nearly $200,000 in prizes this year, cementing his place as one of the best players on the continent.

Junuzovic is another player who has been making a big impact on the European poker scene, with two final table appearances and over $100,000 in prize money won this year. At 31 years old, Junuzovic is one of the older members of Werder Bremen's poker team, but that doesn't seem to have slowed him down one bit.

With so many success stories coming out of Werder Bremen's poker team, it is clear that they are one of the leading clubs on the continent when it comes to this particular game. Their veterans continue to dominate at the highest levels, which is sure to give them plenty of optimism for future tournaments.

#  SV Werder Bremen's poker players showing their age

In a Bundesliga season where very little has gone right for SV Werder Bremen, one bright spot has been the play of the team's two veteran poker players.

39-year-old Clemens Fritz and 37-year-old Zlatko Junuzovic have been two of the team's most consistent performers, with Junuzovic especially standing out in recent weeks.

The pair's experience at the poker table has been a valuable asset for a Bremen squad that is largely made up of young players, and their performances have helped the team to remain in contention for a European berth.

"We're not exactly playing like Barcelona, but we're holding our own," said Fritz after a recent game.

Junuzovic echoed those sentiments, adding: "We've been getting good results by using our heads and making smart decisions."

Those smart decisions have included some impressive hands at the poker table, with both players showing they still have plenty of tricks up their sleeves.

But despite their solid play this season, there is no question that both Fritz and Junuzovic are starting to show their age.

With neither player expected to be around much longer, it will be interesting to see how Bremen cope without their two experienced poker players.

#  SV Werder Bremen prove you're never too old to play poker

For SV Werder Bremen, the lure of poker is as strong as ever - even for those who have retired from professional football.

Ze Roberto is one of those players. The 43-year-old Brazilian has hung up his boots, but he's still coming to the casino to play poker.

"I started playing poker when I was in my early 20s," Ze Roberto says. "It's always been a hobby of mine and I'm really enjoying it now that I've retired from football."

Roberto is one of a number of Bundesliga retirees who enjoy playing poker in their spare time. Daniel Van Buyten, 42, and Sebastian Deisler, 37, are two others who enjoy a game of Texas Hold'em or Omaha Hi-Lo at the casino.

"I think it's a great way to relax and have some fun," Deisler says. "I don't take it too seriously – it's just for entertainment purposes."

Poker is also a great way to keep in touch with former team-mates and rivals. When Deisler takes on Van Buyten at the poker table, they can chat about old times while they're trying to take each other down.

"It's always good to catch up with friends and talk about football when we're all together," Van Buyten says. "But I'm not going to let Deisler beat me too often!"

As well as being enjoyable, playing poker can also be quite lucrative. Some professional players make a living from playing in tournaments or cash games.

And while the majority of Bundesliga retirees don't take things quite so seriously, they can still win some decent money by playing online or in casinos.

Some professional players make a living from playing in tournaments or cash games, while the majority of retirees can win some decent money by playing online or in casinos. Poker offers something that few other sports do: the opportunity to compete against friends and rivals in a fun and relaxed environment
