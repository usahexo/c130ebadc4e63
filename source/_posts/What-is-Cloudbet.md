#  Phoenix Suns?

The Phoenix Suns are a professional basketball team based in Phoenix, Arizona. They are a member of the Pacific Division of the Western Conference in the National Basketball Association (NBA). The Suns play their home games at Talking Stick Resort Arena.

The franchise was founded in 1968 as an expansion team, and has been in the playoffs 19 times, reaching the conference finals five times. The Suns have won two NBA championships, in 1976 and 1993.

Phoenix Suns ARE BACK !!! The Suns haven't had a winning season since 2009-2010 but with some new blood in the locker room and some revamped coaching staff this may be their year! Devin Booker is coming into his 3rd year as a pro and is showing great promise, he averaged over 22 points per game last season. Josh Jackson was drafted 4th overall by the Suns in 2017 and has already made a name for himself as a great defender. Deandre Ayton was drafted #1 overall by the Suns in this years draft and is considered one of the most promising big men to come out of college in a while. With all these young guns on the squad it will be interesting to see how they fare this year!

#  Nietz?

A philosopher by the name of Friedrich Nietzsche once said, "God is dead." But what did he mean by this?

For Nietzsche, it was not a statement of belief but rather a psychological observation. With the rise of rationalism and science in the 18th and 19th centuries, traditional religious beliefs were being called into question. People were increasingly looking to reason and empirical evidence to understand the world, and religious doctrines started to seem like superstitions. God was seen as an outdated concept that no longer had a place in modern society.

Nietzsche believed that this move away from religion would have far-reaching consequences. He predicted that with God gone, human beings would be left without any sense of purpose or meaning in life. This would lead to a nihilistic worldview in which life would be seen as meaningless and absurd.

This prediction has certainly come to pass in some respects. We live in a secular society in which many people no longer believe in God. And while there is still plenty of meaning and purpose to be found in life, there is no denying that nihilism is on the rise. We see it in the increasing popularity of dark metal music and horror movies, and in the way that some people are now celebrating death rather than life.

So is Nietzche right? Is God really dead? I don't know. But I do think that his observations about religion and nihilism are worth considering.
