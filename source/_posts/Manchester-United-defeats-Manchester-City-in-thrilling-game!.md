#  Manchester United defeats Manchester City in thrilling game!

The Manchester derby is always a special occasion, but the latest edition was something truly spectacular. Both teams played some of their best football, and the match ended with Manchester United getting the victory in a thrilling game.

Both sets of fans were in fine voice throughout the game, and there were plenty of exciting moments to enjoy. The opening goal came from United, as Paul Pogba finished off a well-worked move. However, City quickly equalized through Leroy Sane, and things continued to be evenly matched for the remainder of the first half.

In the second half, it was more of the same as both teams looked to take advantage of any opportunity that arose. And it was City who took the lead this time, with David Silva scoring an excellent goal. United didn't give up however, and they managed to level things up again through Chris Smalling.

With minutes remaining, it looked like City would hold on for the win. However, a late goal from Marcus Rashford gave United the win and left the Etihad Stadium in stunned silence. It was an incredible end to an amazing game, and both teams can be proud of their performances.

#  Liverpool draws with Arsenal after late equalizer from Oxlade-Chamberlain

Liverpool 1-1 Arsenal

Arsenal came from behind to earn a Merseyside Derby draw against Liverpool at Anfield. The Gunners were lucky to escape with a point after Philippe Coutinho’s stunning late strike looked to have won it for the home side.

But Liverpool were made to pay for some wasteful finishing as Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain – in his first game against his former club – drilled home an equalizer in the 82nd minute.

The result means that Liverpool miss the opportunity to close the gap on second-placed Manchester United, while Arsenal stay sixth, seven points off the Champions League places.

Jürgen Klopp made four changes from the side which beat Huddersfield Town 2-0 last time out, with Dejan Lovren, Alberto Moreno, Emre Can and Sadio Mané all coming into the starting XI. The Reds boss also named Jordan Henderson captain in the absence of injured regular skipper James Milner.

Arsenal boss Arsène Wenger, meanwhile, made just one alteration from last week’s goalless North London Derby draw against Tottenham Hotspur, with Alexandre Lacazette earning a recall up front at the expense of Danny Welbeck.

It was Liverpool who created the first chance of note in the ninth minute when Mohamed Salah’s ball over the top found Mané unmarked in the area but he couldn’t keep his header down.

Arsenal responded well and should have taken the lead moments later when Mesut Özil whipped in a dangerous free kick which was flicked on by Hector Bellerín but Lacazette somehow managed to head wide from six yards out with only Simon Mignolet to beat.

Liverpool were dealt a further blow shortly afterwards when Can had to be replaced by Gini Wijnaldum due to injury, and they continued to struggle to create chances despite enjoying plenty of possession. In fact, it was Arsenal who went closest to scoring again before the break when Lacazette hit the post after being played through by Özil.

The second half followed a similar pattern with Liverpool seeing most of the ball but they still couldn’t find a way past an Arsenal defence superbly marshalled by Laurent Koscielny and Shkodran Mustafi. As time wore on it looked like both sides would have to settle for a share of the spoils. But then Philippe Coutinho happened…

The Brazilian substitute collected possession 25 yards from goal and let fly with an incredible strike which left Petr Čech with no chance, giving Liverpool what appeared to be three much-needed points. However, there was still enough time for Oxlade-Chamberlain to have his say…

#  Barcelona dominates La Liga early on, only two losses through 15 games

Barcelona has been a powerhouse in La Liga this season. They currently have a record of 10-2-3 and sit 3 points clear of Atletico Madrid and 7 points clear of their rivals Real Madrid. They have been dominant offensively, scoring 42 goals while only conceding 14. This is in large part due to the play of Lionel Messi, who leads the league with 18 goals scored. Some other key contributors for Barcelona this season include Luis Suarez (11 goals) and Philippe Coutinho (7 goals).

The two losses that Barcelona has suffered this season came against Sevilla (2-1) and CD Leganes (2-1). Against Sevilla, they were down 1-0 at halftime but were able to come back and win 2-1. Against CD Leganes, they were down 2-0 heading into the final minutes but were able to pull off two late goals to salvage a point.

Despite these two losses, Barcelona is still in a commanding position to win La Liga this season. They have shown that they are capable of dominating most teams in the league and will be hard to catch up to. If they can continue playing at this high level, they should be able to coast to their 26th La Liga title.

#  Spurs extend unbeaten streak to 14 games with narrow victory over Southampton

Prior to their Premier League match against Southampton, Spurs had not lost in any of their previous 14 outings. Mauricio Pochettino's side knew that a win would see them leapfrog London rivals Chelsea into fourth position on the table.

With Harry Kane back in the starting line-up after illness had kept him out of the team for their midweek Champions League fixture against Borussia Dortmund, Tottenham looked to take the game to Southampton from the outset. Indeed, they carved out a number of chances in the first half but were unable to convert them into goals.

The breakthrough finally came early in the second half when Christian Eriksen found space outside the penalty area and curled a right-footed effort past Fraser Forster in the Southampton goal. Spurs then went on to hold on for the victory, with Kane also hitting the woodwork as they looked to extend their unbeaten streak even further.

The result sees Tottenham move up to fourth place on the Premier League table, just two points behind leaders Liverpool and two ahead of Chelsea, while Southampton are positioned in ninth spot.

#  Carlsbad falls short against Barona Casino in thrilling English Fast League Football

In a hotly contested match, Carlsbad United Football Club narrowly lost to Barona Casino in the English Fast League Football Championship. The home side fielded what looked like their strongest team of the season, while Barona Casino, who are currently in second place in the league, brought a strong squad as well.

The first half was relatively uneventful, with both teams cancelling each other out. The only real chance of the half fell to Carlsbad’s leading scorer, Luke Dale, but his shot was expertly saved by the Barona Casino goalkeeper.

The second half was a different story altogether. Right from the kick-off, Carlsbad United FC seemed to be on the front foot and took the game to their opponents. It wasn’t long before they were rewarded for their efforts when Dale scored an excellent goal after some good work from his strike partner.

However, Barona Casino weren’t about to give up without a fight and they equalized just ten minutes later through a well-worked team move. From then on it was all end-to-end stuff as both teams went for the win.

In the end it was Barona Casino who clinched victory with a late goal that left the Carlsbad United FC players heartbroken. It was an excellent game of football and one that will live long in the memory for all those involved.
