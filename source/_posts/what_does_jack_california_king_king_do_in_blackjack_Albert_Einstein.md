# What Does Jack, Queen, and King Do in Blackjack?

When it comes to playing Blackjack, the face cards, Jack, Queen, and King are worth 10 points each. They hold great significance in the game and can help players make or break their hand. In this article, we will discuss what Jack, Queen, and King do in Blackjack and how to use them effectively.

## The Value of Jack, Queen, and King

As mentioned earlier, Jack, Queen, and King in Blackjack are worth 10 points each. This means that if you get any of these cards in your hand, your total hand value will increase by 10. It's essential to keep in mind that even though these cards have different names, they have the same value in the game.

## Using Jack, Queen, and King in Blackjack

To use these face cards effectively in Blackjack, players must understand the game's objective. The goal of the game is to have a hand value of 21 or closer to it than the dealer. If a player goes over 21, they "bust" and lose the game.

If a player receives a Jack, Queen, or King in their starting hand, it's known as a "natural" or "Blackjack." A Blackjack is the best hand in the game and consists of an Ace and any card worth 10 points. When a player has a Blackjack, they will win automatically, and the dealer will pay them 1.5 times their original bet.

However, if a player doesn't have a natural, they can use their Jack, Queen, and King to improve their hand value. For instance, if a player has a Queen and a 7, they can use the Queen's value to make their hand worth 17, which is a decent hand in Blackjack.

## Conclusion

In conclusion, Jack, Queen, and King are vital cards in Blackjack and can make a significant difference in a player's hand. They have a value of 10 points each and can help players get closer to 21, the game's objective. If a player gets a natural, consisting of an Ace and a 10-point card, they win the game automatically. However, if they don't have a natural, they can use the face cards' value to improve their hand and beat the dealer.
