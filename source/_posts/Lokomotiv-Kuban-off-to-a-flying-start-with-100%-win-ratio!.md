#  Lokomotiv Kuban off to a flying start with 100% win ratio!

With the new season of the VTB United League underway, Lokomotiv Kuban have made an excellent start, winning all four of their opening games to top the table. This is a particularly impressive achievement when you consider that they’ve had to do it without their star player, Dmitry Kulagin. Kulagin was sidelined at the beginning of the season after picking up an injury while playing for Russia at the EuroBasket 2017 tournament.

Coach Giorgi Shermadini has been able to rotate his squad effectively in Kulagin’s absence, and new signings Evgeny Voronov and Sergey Karasev have settled in well. Voronov has been one of the standout players so far this season, averaging 14 points and 5 rebounds per game. Meanwhile, Karasev has been impressive from three-point range, shooting 45% from beyond the arc.

Lokomotiv’s next game is against UNICS Kazan on October 18th. This will be a tough test for them, but with four wins from four games, they will go into it full of confidence.

#  Lokomotiv Kuban maintain perfect record with fourth consecutive win!

Lokomotiv Kuban continue their perfect record in the new Euroleague season with their fourth consecutive win, this time against Baskonia. The game was very close in the beginning, but Lokomotiv Kuban managed to pull away in the second half and take the victory by a margin of 83-72.

This was another great team victory for Lokomotiv Kuban, who are now looking like one of the favorites to win the Euroleague title this season. They have been playing very well as a team, with all players contributing and making important plays when necessary.

The biggest stars for Lokomotiv Kuban in this game were Janis Timma and Marcus Thornton. Timma led the team with 21 points on 9-of-14 shooting, and Thornton added 20 points on 8-of-13 shooting. They both proved to be difficult matchup for Baskonia’s defense, and they will need to continue playing at this level if Lokomotiv Kuban want to make a deep run in Euroleague this season.

Another player who had a great game was Nikola Milutinov, who came off the bench to contribute 14 points and 8 rebounds. He was a big factor in Lokomotiv Kuban’s second half surge, and he is proving to be an important player for them this season.

Overall, it was another great win for Lokomotiv Kuban, who are looking like one of the top teams in Europe. They will need to continue playing well if they want to keep their perfect record intact, but they certainly have the talent to do so.

#  Lokomotiv Kuban make it five in a row with another comprehensive victory!

Lokomotiv Kuban Krasnodar consolidated their place at the top of the VTB United League standings on Wednesday night with a 103-81 victory over reigning champions CSKA Moscow.

It was another comprehensive display from Dmitry Sokolov’s side, who have now won their last five games in a row and look well on course for a successful season.

There were standout performances all over the court for Lokomotiv, but particular mention must go to Cory Jefferson, who finished with 23 points and 17 rebounds. Point guard Shannon Brown was also impressive, contributing 18 points and six assists.

CSKA had no answer to Lokomotiv’s firepower and never looked likely to mount a serious challenge, with Nikola Milutinov scoring 22 points and 11 rebounds in defeat.

The result leaves CSKA in fourth place in the standings, eight games behind leaders Lokomotiv with just 12 left to play.

Lokomotiv have looked in excellent shape so far, with some impressive wins over top opposition. Their biggest win of the season was a 112-87 victory over defending champions CSKA Moscow. This demonstrates just how capable they are of competing at the top level and gives them a great chance of challenging for the title this year.

They have also recorded wins against Zenit Saint Petersburg, Khimki Moscow Region, UNICS Kazan and Enisey Krasnoyarsk, highlighting their strong all-round form. They will now be looking to record more victories in order to maintain their place at the top of the table.

Lokomotiv Kuban appear to be on a mission this season – to prove that they are one of Europe’s top teams. And so far, they have shown no signs of slowing down. Can anyone stop them?
