#  49ers Making a Push for Playoffs, Oddsmakers Set Line

The San Francisco 49ers are making a strong push for the playoffs and according to the oddsmakers, they have a good chance of making it.

The 49ers are listed as a 6.5-point underdog against the Los Angeles Rams this week, but they could be in line for an upset win.

San Francisco is coming off a big win over the Seattle Seahawks last week and they will be looking to keep the momentum going this week.

Jimmy Garoppolo has been impressive since taking over as the starting quarterback and he will be looking to lead the 49ers to their first playoff berth in six years.

If the 49ers can win their final four games, they will clinch a playoff spot.

#  49ers Go into Monday Night Football as Underdogs

In their Week 6 matchup, the San Francisco 49ers will be looking to pull off an upset as they travel to take on the Green Bay Packers as underdogs.

The Niners are coming off a bye week, which they likely needed after dropping three straight games leading up to their break. In that stretch, San Francisco gave up 34 points per game and failed to score more than 20 themselves.

Green Bay, on the other hand, is coming off of a big home win against the defending Super Bowl champions. The Packers scored 27 unanswered points in the second half to come from behind and beat the Seattle Seahawks.

While Aaron Rodgers and company are certainly a tough opponent, this game is far from a guaranteed victory for them. The Packers have only managed to cover the spread in two of their five games so far this season, and they are coming into Monday night as sizable favorites.

There is no question that the 49ers have plenty of talent on both sides of the ball. With Jim Harbaugh back at the helm, they should always be considered contenders. If they can put together a solid performance against Green Bay, there is no reason why they can’t come away with an upset victory.

#  San Francisco 49ers: A Look at the Odds and How to Bet Them

The San Francisco 49ers may have stumbled last season, but they are still a team to be reckoned with. Let's take a look at their odds for this upcoming season and how to bet them.

According to Odds Shark, the 49ers have odds of +2000 to win the Super Bowl this year. This means that if you wager $100 on the 49ers, you would win $2000 if they won the Super Bowl. They also have odds of 9/1 to make it to the Super Bowl.

Looking at these odds, it's pretty clear that the 49ers are underdogs this year. However, that doesn't mean that they can't pull off an upset. If you're feeling lucky, you could bet on them to win the Super Bowl.

However, there are other bets that you can make on the 49ers as well. You could bet on them to make the playoffs or even to win their division. These bets offer much better odds and are a safer bet than betting on them to win the Super Bowl.

So, if you're looking for a team to root for this season, consider betting on the San Francisco 49ers. With some luck and good coaching, they could surprise everyone and make a run for the Super Bowl.

#  49ers Seeing Increased Action After Wentz Injury


While the injury to Philadelphia Eagles quarterback Carson Wentz may have been a devastating one for Eagles fans, it has created some opportunities for the San Francisco 49ers.

With Wentz out, Nick Foles is now the starter and the backup is Nate Sudfeld. The 49ers were already scheduled to play the Eagles in Week 13, and with Wentz out, that game now has increased importance for San Francisco.

The 49ers are 1-point underdogs in that game, but they could very well pull off the upset. They have won two games in a row and four of their last six games.

Their offense has been clicking lately, with quarterback Jimmy Garoppolo playing well and receivers Marquise Goodwin and Pierre Garcon both being productive. The defense has also been playing better, led by linebacker Reuben Foster.

If the 49ers can win their next two games — against the Chicago Bears this week and then the Eagles in Week 13 — they will be in good position to make a playoff run.
