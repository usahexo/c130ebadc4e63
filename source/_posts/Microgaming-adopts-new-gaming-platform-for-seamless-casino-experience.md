Now, Microgaming is taking things a step further with a new commitment to promoting responsible gaming. This includes working with regulators and other stakeholders tohelp identify and address problem gambling, as well as developing new tools and resources for players.

Some of these new measures include enhanced age verification processes and self-exclusion options. Players will also have access tobetter information on how to gamble responsibly, including tips on setting limits and recognising problem gambling behaviour.

Microgaming’s Head of Responsible Gaming, Dr. Tony Andersen, commented on the announcement: “We are committed to promoting responsible gaming across our entire portfolio of products and services. We believe that these new measures will further protect players while also providing them with valuable information on how to gamble responsibly.”

This announcement builds on Microgaming’s existing responsible gaming initiatives, which include the formation of the Responsible Gaming Council in 2014.

#  Microgaming Adopts new payment methods

Microgaming, one of the leading online casino software providers, is expanding its payment methods to include new ones such as Bitcoin and Ethereum. This will make it easier for players to deposit and withdraw money while enjoying their favourite Microgaming games.

Bitcoin is a digital asset and a payment system invented by Satoshi Nakamoto. It is popular because it is secure, fast and low-cost. Transactions are verified by network nodes through cryptography and recorded in a public dispersed ledger called a blockchain. Ethereum is a decentralised platform that runs smart contracts: applications that run exactly as programmed without any possibility of fraud or third party interference.

Microgaming's Head of Casino, James Kennedy, said: "We are always looking for new ways to improve the player experience and our latest payment methods will do just that. Players can now choose from a variety of options when depositing and withdrawing funds."

The company has been at the forefront of the online gaming industry since 1994 and offers over 850 unique casino games, including slots, table games and progressive jackpots. With its new payment methods, Microgaming is poised to remain the industry leader for many years to come.

#  Microgaming adopts Instant Play

Microgaming, one of the pioneers in the online casino industry, has announced that it is to adopt an Instant Play platform.

Instant Play is a new technology that allows players to access casino games without having to download any software. It works by using a web browser to load games directly from the casino’s website. This means that players can play on any device, including laptops, smartphones and tablets.

Microgaming has been working on the Instant Play platform for two years and has conducted extensive tests with a range of different devices. The company is confident that the platform will be a major hit with players and expects it to be widely adopted.

In a statement, Microgaming’s CEO John Coleman said: “We are delighted to launch our new Instant Play platform, which offers our players the best possible experience on any device, anywhere in the world.”

He added: “This is another major step forward for Microgaming as we continue to lead the field in innovation and player experience.”

The Instant Play platform will be made available to all Microgaming licensees later this year.
