#  How to Determine Bingo Prizes - Sierra Leone 

A bingo game can be a fun way to spend an evening with friends, and it’s easy to determine the prizes. In Sierra Leone, the basic prize for bingo is $10.

For three players, the prize is split evenly, and for four or more players, the prize is divided equally among the top three players.

If you want to add a bit of excitement to your bingo game, consider using some of these alternate prize structures:

- For five players or more, give the first place winner a $25 prize, second place a $15 prize, and third place a $10 prize.
