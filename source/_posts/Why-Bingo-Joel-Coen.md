#  Why Bingo Joel Coen?

A question that has been asked by many moviegoers, and one that doesn't seem to have a definitive answer, is why Joel Coen's character in "The Big Lebowski" is named Bingo.

Coen has stated that the name was originally going to be "Otis" but they couldn't get the rights, so they went with Bingo as a placeholder. Some theories about the character's name include it being a reference to the game of bingo or to jazz singer Bing Crosby. Others believe that it might be a reference to the Vietnam War, where troops would call out "bingo" when they had all five of their letter cards and could spell the word.

One popular fan theory is that Coen's character is actually named after bowling phenomenon Donny "The Dude" Larson. Larson was known for his perfect gamer and 300 score at the age of 14, which Coen references in the movie when The Dude says "I'm not Mr. Lebowski. You're Mr. Lebowski. I'm The Dude."

No one can be sure of why Joel Coen's character in "The Big Lebowski" is named Bingo, but it's definitely an intriguing mystery that continues to interest fans of the movie.
