# Gaming addiction can be successfully treated, study finds

Gaming addiction is a real condition that can be successfully treated with therapy, a new study has found.

The study, conducted by researchers at the University of Bonn in Germany and published in the journal Addiction, found that cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) was an effective treatment for gaming addiction.

The study involved 120 participants who were all addicted to video games. Participants were randomly assigned to one of two groups – the CBT group or the control group.

The CBT group received 12 sessions of cognitive behavioral therapy, while the control group did not receive any treatment.

At the end of the study, participants in the CBT group had significantly lower levels of addiction than those in the control group. They also had improved mental health and reduced depression and anxiety symptoms.

“Our findings suggest that cognitive behavioral therapy is an effective treatment for gaming addiction and that it should be considered for people who are unable to reduce their game playing despite desires to do so,” lead author Dr. Christine Northam said in a statement.

#  Recovering gaming addicts offered support group

A new online support group has been created to help recovering gaming addicts.

The group, which is called "Recovery from Gaming Addiction," offers a safe and supportive environment for recovering addicts to share their experiences and receive encouragement from others who are also in recovery.

Addicts who have struggled with gaming addiction are often ashamed and embarrassed about their addiction, so the group offers a place where they can feel safe and accepted.

The group is moderated by a licensed therapist, who provides support and guidance as needed. The therapist also helps members set healthy boundaries with gaming and other activities that can be addictive.

The group is open to anyone who wants to recover from gaming addiction, regardless of age, race, or gender. It is free to join, and there are no membership fees.

#  Chances of recovering from gaming addiction depend on severity of problem

The first step in recovering from any addiction is acknowledging that there is a problem. For many people who struggle with gaming addiction, this may be the most difficult step of all. Admitting that there is a problem and seeking help is the best chance for recovery.

However, the severity of the addiction will determine how successful the recovery process will be. If the addiction is mild, then there is a good chance of recovery with proper treatment. However, if the addiction is more severe, then it may be more difficult to overcome without extensive treatment.

In general, recovering from an addiction requires three basic steps: detoxification, rehabilitation, and aftercare. Detoxification is necessary to rid the body of all traces of the addictive substance. Rehabilitation provides counseling and support to help people stay sober after detoxification. Aftercare involves continued counseling and support to help people stay sober long-term.

For gaming addicts, detoxification may involve ridding oneself of all gaming devices and software. Rehabilitation may include learning new coping skills and strategies for handling stress. Aftercare may include attending support groups or therapy sessions on a regular basis.

The key to success in recovering from a gaming addiction is taking things one step at a time and getting as much help as possible. With hard work and dedication, it is possible to overcome an addiction and lead a healthy and productive life

#  Gaming addiction can lead to depression and other mental health problems

According to the American Psychological Association, spending too much time playing video games may be linked with mental health problems like depression and anxiety. The report also suggests that people who are addicted to gaming may be at risk for developing other addictive behaviors and even suffer from poor academic performance.

One study that was published in the journal "Psychology of Addictive Behaviors" found that men who scored high on measures of gaming addiction were more likely to report symptoms of depression and anxiety. Another study, which was published in the journal "Cyberpsychology, Behavior, and Social Networking," found that excessive gaming can lead to social isolation, decreased academic performance, and job loss.

So why are video games so addictive? According to experts, one reason is that they trigger the release of dopamine, a neurotransmitter that's associated with pleasure. This can create a feedback loop in which gamers keep playing games in order to get more dopamine rushes.

If you think you or someone you know might be addicted to video games, there are steps that can be taken to address the problem. One approach is cognitive-behavioral therapy, which can help people learn how to manage their thoughts and emotions related to gaming.

If you're concerned about your child's gaming habits, it's important to have a conversation with them about the risks associated with excessive gaming. You can also set rules about how much time they're allowed to spend playing games each day.

#  Recovery from gaming addiction is possible with help

Addiction to gaming is a problem that is often not taken seriously. It can, however, be very serious. Those who are addicted to gaming may find themselves unable to stop playing, even when it has negative consequences in their lives.

Recovery from addiction to gaming is possible, but it requires help. There are many different types of help available, including counseling, therapy, and support groups. It is important to find the type of help that is best suited to your needs.

If you are addicted to gaming and would like to seek help, there are a few things you should know. First, it is important to understand that addiction is a disease. This means that it cannot be cured overnight and there is no one-size-fits-all solution. Recovery will be different for everyone.

Second, seeking help for addiction is not easy. It takes courage and strength to admit that you have a problem and ask for help. However, it is worth it in the end. With the right support and treatment, you can overcome your addiction and live a healthy and happy life.
