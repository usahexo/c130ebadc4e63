#  Benicio Del Toro Could Lose Millions Spinning Casino Slot Machines

Hollywood actor Benicio Del Toro is reportedly in line to lose millions of dollars after becoming hooked on spinning the reels of casino slot machines.

The 49-year-old star, who is said to have a compulsive gambling habit, became embroiled in a high-stakes game of chance while staying at the Bellagio hotel in Las Vegas.

He is said to have blown $7000 in just two hours playing some of the most popular slots on the casino floor.

Del Toro is not the only Hollywood star with a penchant for gambling – Leonardo DiCaprio, Matt Damon and Tobey Maguire are also said to enjoy a flutter.

But Del Toro’s problem could be more serious as he has reportedly lost millions of dollars in the past through his addiction.

In 2010 it was reported that he had lost around $1 million in a single night while playing blackjack at the Hard Rock Casino in Las Vegas.

And in 2012 he was banned from entering the Las Vegas casinos after amassing $50,000 worth of debt.

It is not clear how much money he has now lost as a result of his addiction to slot machines, but sources say it could be tens of millions of dollars.

Slot machines are often referred to as the “crack cocaine” of gambling because they are so addictive.

They are particularly attractive to problem gamblers because they offer seemingly low risks and big rewards.

Slot machines account for around 70 percent of all gambling losses in casinos, which means that they are responsible for billions of dollars being squandered each year.

#  How Much Does Benicio Del Toro Spend Gambling in a Day?

It’s no secret that Benicio Del Toro is a big gambler. In fact, he even has a few casino credits to his name. But how much does he actually spend in a day? Let’s take a look.

There’s no definitive answer, as Benicio is notoriously tight-lipped about his gambling habits. However, we can make some educated guesses.

For starters, let’s look at the bets he’s made over the years. In 2004, he placed a bet of $1 million on a football game between Manchester United and Chelsea. He also wagered $250,000 on the Super Bowl that year. And in 2012, he reportedly bet $500,000 on blackjack at the Bellagio in Las Vegas.

Assuming he continues to make similar-sized bets, we can estimate that Benicio spends around $3 million per year on gambling. This works out to around $250,000 per month or $8,333 per day.

Of course, this figure could be lower or higher depending on how often he gambles and the size of his average bets. But it gives us a good idea of how much money Benicio spends on gambling each day.

#  Benicio Del Toro Could Really Use a Win on the Slot Machines

Benicio del Toro is an Academy Award-winning actor, but he could probably use a win on the slot machines.

In a recent interview with “The Daily Beast,” Del Toro said that he’s been struggling with addiction to gambling for years.

“I do it to escape. I do it to feel good,” Del Toro said.

Del Toro reportedly owes millions of dollars to casinos in Las Vegas and Atlantic City. In the past, he has admitted to spending $2 million in a single year at casinos.

He has also tried to get help for his addiction, but so far, nothing has worked.

“I went to a place called Cirque Lodge in Utah… It didn’t work for me because I am who I am. I like going out, I like drinking, and I like gambling,” Del Toro said.

This isn’t the first time that Del Toro has had money troubles. He previously declared bankruptcy in 2009 after racking up $9 million in debt.

Hopefully, Del Toro can get his gambling addiction under control before it destroys him financially and emotionally.

#  Benicio Del Toro Hits the Casino Slot Machines Hard

Actor Benicio Del Toro has always been known for his relaxed and easy-going lifestyle, but it seems that his carefree nature may have led him to some bad decision-making when it comes to gambling. As reported by TMZ, Del Toro was recently caught on camera at a casino in Las Vegas hitting the slot machines hard, playing games for hours on end and losing thousands of dollars in the process.

It's not clear exactly how much money Del Toro lost at the casino, but sources say that he was playing high-stakes slot machines and was down by as much as $8,000 at one point. In video footage from the casino, Del Toro can be seen casually chatting with other players as he feeds coins into the machine, seemingly unconcerned about the amount of money he's losing.

This isn't the first time that Del Toro has had a run-in with gambling addiction; back in 2013 he admitted to spending $2 million at casinos in a six-month period. It looks like he may be struggling with the same addiction again now, and it's definitely not a healthy habit to get into.

Regardless of whether or not you agree with gambling, it's clear that Del Toro is in way over his head here and needs to walk away from the slots before he loses any more money. With a net worth of over $50 million, he can certainly afford to do so without too much difficulty, and hopefully he'll take this lesson to heart and stay away from the casino tables from now on.

#  Does Benicio Del Toro Ever Win at the Casino Slot Machines?

The actor Benicio Del Toro is known for his roles in films such as Traffic and The Wolf of Wall Street. But does he have any luck when it comes to casino slot machines?

There's no definitive answer, but there are a few things to consider. For one, Del Toro has spoken about his love of gambling in the past. In a 2013 interview with GQ, he said: "Gambling is my drug of choice. I like that high."

He's also said that he enjoys playing the slots in particular. "The slots are the best," he told Vegas magazine in 2012. "You can lose or win quickly."

So it seems that Del Toro enjoys the thrill of gambling and isn't afraid to risk losing money. This could be a good sign, as it suggests that he's not averse to taking risks - something which could be useful at the casino slot machines.

However, there are also some signs that Del Toro may not be quite so lucky when it comes to gambling. For example, he lost a reported $2 million in a single night playing blackjack in 2014. And in 2013, he admitted that he had blown through $6 million over the previous six years while gambling.

Overall, it's hard to say whether Benicio Del Toro is a successful gambler or not. He seems to enjoy playing casino games and doesn't mind risking large sums of money, but he's also suffered some heavy losses in the past. So it's likely that his success (or lack thereof) at the slots varies from time to time.
