 teammate Dwight Howard added: "We're just having fun and enjoying the moment. It's great to see our hard work pay off."

On a recent night, the Atlanta Hawks basketball team took down the top progressive internet casino game jackpot. The win came as a surprise to many, as the Hawks are not typically known for their prowess in the world of online gambling.

The game in question was a progressive slot machine known as Mega Moolah. This particular title is well-known for paying out large sums of money on a regular basis, and the Hawks’ victory only served to reinforce that reputation.

Mega Moolah is a five-reel slot machine with 25 paylines. It is set in an African safari theme, and features symbols such as lions, elephants, and zebras. The game also has a number of special features, including a wild symbol, a scatter symbol, and a free spins bonus round.

The Mega Moolah jackpot is constantly increasing, and it pays out randomly on any spin of the reels. The current jackpot stands at over $5 million, so it’s no wonder that so many people are drawn to this game.

To win the Mega Moolah jackpot, you need to hit the five scatter symbols on the reels. This may seem like an impossible task, but it can actually happen fairly often if you’re lucky. In fact, there have been numerous instances where players have won the jackpot with only a single spin of the reels.

If you’re feeling lucky tonight, why not try your hand at Mega Moolah? You might just be the next big winner!
