#  What is the impact of information technology on society?

Since the early days of information technology, society has been profoundly affected. IT has revolutionized how people interact and has had a significant impact on many different aspects of society, including the economy, governance, education, and health care.

One of the most profound impacts of IT on society is its role in the economy. The advent of the Internet and the global digital network has allowed for the globalization of business, making it easier than ever for companies to conduct business in new markets around the world. In addition, online auction websites such as eBay have allowed consumers to buy and sell products and services with ease. Moreover, the development of mobile apps and other software that facilitates e-commerce has made it possible for people to conduct transactions from anywhere at any time.

Another key impact of IT on society is its role in governance. The use of social media tools such as Facebook and Twitter has allowed citizens to communicate with their elected officials and express their opinions on issues that are important to them. In addition, online voting systems have made it possible for people to vote from anywhere in the world, which has made elections more accessible to people who live in remote areas or who cannot afford to travel to polling stations.

IT has also had a significant impact on education. The widespread use of computers and the Internet in schools has allowed students to access information from around the world at any time. It has also allowed them to collaborate with classmates from around the globe on projects that would have been impossible before the advent of digital communication tools. In addition, online learning platforms such as Coursera have made it possible for students to take courses from some of the best universities in the world without having to leave their homes.

Finally, IT has also had a profound impact on health care. The use of electronic medical records (EMRs) has made it easier for doctors and other health care professionals to track patients’ medical history and current health conditions. EMRs have also made it easier for doctors to prescribe medication and order tests electronically, which can save patients time and money. In addition, telemedicine tools such as Skype have made it possible for patients to receive consultations from doctors located far away without having to leave their homes

#  What is the future of information technology? 

Information technology has been rapidly evolving since the early days of computing. What started as giant mainframes has evolved into desktop and laptop PCs, then to portable devices like smartphones and tablets, and now to cloud-based services. Each step of the way, information technology has become more versatile, morepowerful, and more affordable.

What will be the next step in this evolution? There are several possible scenarios:

1. More powerful portable devices.

With faster processors, better graphics capabilities, and larger displays, portable devices will become even more powerful and capable of replacing traditional PCs for many tasks.

2. More cloud-based services.

As people become increasingly comfortable with using online services for everything from banking to shopping to healthcare, we will see even more services moving to the cloud. This will result in a more seamless experience across all devices, with no need to install software or updates.

3. More use of artificial intelligence and machine learning.

As these technologies continue to improve, they will play an ever-growing role in the way we use information technology. This will enable us to automate many tasks currently done by humans, resulting in faster, more accurate results.

Whatever the future holds, it is sure to be exciting!
