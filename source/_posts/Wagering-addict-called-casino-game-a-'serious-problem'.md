#  Wagering addict called casino game a 'serious problem'

It has been reported that a wagering addict has labelled casino games as a 'serious problem.' The anonymous addict, who is reportedly in recovery, said that he or she became obsessed with the thrill of gambling and lost thousands of pounds in the process.

The addiction is said to have had a devastating effect on the gambler's personal life, with relationships and work suffering as a result. Speaking to The Mirror, the addict said: "Gambling is not about money, it’s about the buzz you get from it. You can be winning £1,000 but if you don’t have that buzz then it’s not worth it."

This revelation comes as no surprise; gambling addiction is a very real problem which can have serious consequences for the individual and those around them. While casinos make billions of pounds each year, their profits come at a cost to those who are unable to control their gambling habit.

It is hoped that by speaking out about his or her experience, this addict will help others who may be struggling with a gambling addiction. Gambling addiction can be incredibly difficult to overcome on your own, so seeking professional help is often recommended.

#  Wagering addicts can be helped by casino game

It is no secret that a lot of people develop an addiction to gambling, with the lure of easy money proving too strong for some. However, what is not so well known is that there are treatments available for those addicted to casino games.

One such treatment is cognitive behavioural therapy, which helps addicts to learn how to resist the urge to gamble and instead focuses on positive behaviours. This type of therapy has been found to be successful in helping many people overcome their addiction to casino games.

Another treatment option for gambling addicts is medication-assisted treatment. This approach involves giving people prescription drugs that help to reduce cravings and impulsivity. Some people find this type of treatment helpful in managing their addiction, while others find that it does not work for them.

Whatever treatment option an addict chooses, it is important that they receive support from family and friends throughout the process. Addiction is a disease that can be managed with the right help, and those affected by it should not feel ashamed or embarrassed. There is no shame in seeking help for a problem like this – in fact, it takes courage.

#  Casino game may protect against wagering addiction

A recent study found that people who played casino games, such as blackjack or roulette, were less likely to develop a gambling problem. The study, which was published in the journal Addictive Behaviors, surveyed over 5,000 people about their gambling behavior. It found that those who played casino games were around 50% less likely to develop a gambling problem.

The study’s lead author, Dr. Thorsten Quandt from the University of Jena in Germany, said that the findings could help to reduce the number of people who develop a gambling addiction. “Our findings suggest that playing casino games may protect against developing a gambling problem,” he said.

Dr. Quandt added that further research is needed to determine why casino games seem to be protective against gambling addiction. He speculated that one possible explanation could be that casino games are more skill-based than other types of gambling games, such as slot machines. “It may be that people who are good at casino games find them less addictive because they enjoy playing and winning,” he said.

While the study found a correlation between casino game playing and reduced odds of developing a gambling problem, it did not prove that one caused the other. However, the findings provide strong evidence for further research into this area. If it is confirmed that casino games do indeed protect against gambling addiction, this could have important implications for public health policy.
